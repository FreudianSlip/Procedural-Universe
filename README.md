Procedural Universe
===================

Procedural Universe is an attempt to create a fully procedural generator for stars, planets, solar systems, and ultimately entire galaxies.

Emphasis will be placed on speed by generating only the specific levels of detail needed for what is visible.  Eventually, it is hoped it would be fast enough and detailed enough to be used in a First-Person game.
